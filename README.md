# USSI Nexus

USSI Nexus is USSI Global's internal operations portal for invoice generation, nonconforming-material tracking, employee training records, and inventory lifecycle reporting. This repository contains the Lucee/CFML implementation and preserves the established browser workflows and API contracts from the original Logicore Portal application.

## Core capabilities

### Invoice Generator

- Promethean Workshop invoices
- Promethean Storage and Small Parts invoices
- Promethean FedEx shipment uploads
- AMC warehouse invoices
- TCL warehouse invoices
- Philips warehouse and repair invoices
- Pricing, dimensions, and reference-data administration

### Operations modules

- **SMS NonConforming:** record management, search, numbering, XLSX exports, and Zebra ZPL labels
- **Training Tracker:** training weeks, topics, videos, sessions, rosters, attendance, signatures, scanned sign-off sheets, and reports
- **Inventory Management:** receiving, shipping, repair, and FedEx imports; file and event deduplication; lifecycle history; shipping reports; quality audits; overrides; whitelist management; and CSV/XLSX exports
- **Administration:** portal users, section-level permissions, Training Tracker roles, and section-level generated-file authorization

## Technology

- Lucee 7 and CFML
- CommandBox for local runtime management
- H2 for persistent application data
- Apache POI through Lucee/Java interoperability for Excel processing
- Tailwind CSS, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the existing frontend

## Brand identity

- **Product name:** USSI Nexus
- **Organization:** USSI Global
- **Primary brand colors:** USSI navy (`#0B2B74`) and USSI blue (`#0071BA`)
- **Application assets:** `static/ussi_nexus_mark.png` and `static/ussi_global_logo.png`

The application uses the supplied USSI Global artwork without redrawing the corporate mark. The circular mark is used for the favicon, sidebar, and compact application surfaces; the horizontal corporate logo is used on sign-in.

Detailed usage rules are recorded in [`BRANDING.md`](BRANDING.md).

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- [CommandBox](https://www.ortussolutions.com/products/commandbox)
- A supported Java runtime for the installed CommandBox/Lucee version
- Python 3.12 only when running the automated parity client

From the repository root on Windows:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\Setup-Local.ps1
box install commandbox-cfconfig --force
box server start
```

The setup script downloads the pinned H2 database driver into `lib/` and verifies its SHA-256 checksum. The driver is intentionally excluded from Git because it is a third-party binary.

The local server opens at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000/index.cfm
```

The runtime is configured in [`server.json`](server.json).

### First-run account

An empty development database creates the designated `matt.shaw` bootstrap administrator. The login page does not display bootstrap credentials, and the password is stored only as a one-way hash.

Automated or isolated environments can override the bootstrap account with the `USSI_NEXUS_BOOTSTRAP_USERNAME` and `USSI_NEXUS_BOOTSTRAP_PASSWORD` environment variables.

> **Security requirement:** The bootstrap account is intended only for initial setup. Change its password before exposing an instance to any shared or public network.

## Runtime data

The application creates and updates the following local directories:

| Directory | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `data/` | H2 database and uploaded training sign-off records |
| `uploads/` | Temporary source files received by portal workflows |
| `outputs/` | Generated invoices, reports, and access metadata |
| `config/` | Versioned defaults plus runtime reference-data overrides |

Runtime databases, uploads, generated outputs, and mutable configuration files are excluded from version control. Back up the persistent directories according to the deployment's retention requirements.

## Validation

The automated validation suite starts a real Lucee instance and verifies:

- Health, login, portal navigation, and permission enforcement
- All invoice analysis, confirmation, generation, and download workflows
- Workbook sheet names, headers, formulas, metadata cells, dates, and identifier types
- Workshop billing history, duplicate exclusion, price tiers, and companion workbooks
- NonConforming CRUD, exports, numbering, and label output
- Training attendance, PDFs, signed-sheet uploads, ZIP/XLSX reports, and roles
- Inventory imports, duplicate detection, lifecycle views, reporting, and restricted-user access

The test definitions are located in:

- [`.github/workflows/lucee-smoke-test.yml`](.github/workflows/lucee-smoke-test.yml)
- [`tests/billing_parity.cfm`](tests/billing_parity.cfm)
- [`tests/http_parity.py`](tests/http_parity.py)

The `.github/workflows` files are retained for the upstream GitHub validation workflow. GitLab does not execute GitHub Actions; configure a GitLab CI pipeline separately if validation must run natively in this project.

## Apache + Lucee deployment

A production-ready Apache 2.4/Lucee 7 deployment package is included in the repository:

- [Apache + Lucee deployment guide](DEPLOYMENT_APACHE_LUCEE.md)
- `deploy/prepare-linux.sh` for the verified H2 dependency, writable directories, and optional Apache site installation
- `deploy/apache/ussi-nexus-vhost.conf.example` for explicit `index.cfm` routing, Lucee proxying, and source/runtime access controls
- `deploy/check-deployment.sh` for post-deployment health, routing, static asset, and access-control checks
- `.htaccess` for managed Apache environments that permit per-directory rules

The supplied Apache virtual host uses `AllowOverride None` and embeds the authoritative rules. Do not deploy the repository behind Apache without either that virtual host or the equivalent `.htaccess` rules.

## Production checklist

Before deploying beyond a developer workstation:

- Replace the bootstrap administrator password and create named administrator accounts.
- Serve the portal through HTTPS and enable secure session cookies in `Application.cfc`.
- Keep `data/`, `uploads/`, `outputs/`, application source, and configuration files inaccessible from direct web requests.
- Provide persistent storage and backups for the H2 database and required uploaded records.
- Limit filesystem permissions to the service account running Lucee.
- Set upload, request-size, reverse-proxy, and retention limits appropriate for production workloads.
- Run the full authenticated parity suite against an isolated test instance after deployment changes.

## Repository structure

| Path | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `Application.cfc` | Application bootstrap, datasource, sessions, service registration, and request protection |
| `index.cfm` | Main router and API surface |
| `routes/` | Training Tracker and Inventory Management route handlers |
| `services/` | Authentication, configuration, invoices, Excel, reporting, training, inventory, and output services |
| `static/` | Frontend CSS, JavaScript, and images |
| `views/` | Lucee-compatible portal shell |
| `template/` | Invoice templates and source-compatible workbook layouts |
| `config/` | Reference data and default configuration |
| `lib/` | Pinned Apache POI runtime dependencies |
| `migration/` | Conversion-time templates and rendering utilities |
| `tests/` | Billing fixtures and authenticated end-to-end parity tests |

## Compatibility and source synchronization

The Lucee implementation retains the existing browser and API contracts while emitting explicit `/index.cfm/...` application URLs for reliable Apache/Lucee proxying. This allows the established frontend to operate without a simultaneous UI rewrite.

The upstream asset-import workflow can synchronize unchanged frontend assets, workbook templates, logos, reference JSON, and rendered portal markup from the original Flask repository. Python/Jinja is used only by that conversion-time workflow; the deployed application itself runs on Lucee/CFML.
